# Kaggle_comps
This is my repository of scripts I created for kaggle competitions. I have not included files from these competitions as they are too large.

Currently, this includes: 
	Quora Question Pairs - Multi-input Keras LSTM Neural Network
   
Feel free to comment with any improvements or suggestions!
